[[TRAITOBJECT]]

[[NON_DISPATCHABLE]]



---

> Object safe traits can be the **base trait of** a trait object. A trait is object safe if it has the following qualities (defined in RFC 255):

> All **supertraits** must also be object safe.

> Sized must not be a supertrait. In other words, it must **not require Self: Sized.**

> It must **not have any associated constants.**

> All associated functions must either be **dispatchable** from a trait object or be explicitly **non-dispatchable** *(means cannot call method or func).*

## Functionality

### Dispatchable functions require

  - [x] **Not have any type parameters** (although lifetime parameters are allowed).
  - [x] be **a method that does not use Self except in the type of the receiver.**

### Have a receiver with one of the following types

  - [x] `&Self (i.e. &self)`
  - [x] `&mut Self (i.e &mut self)`
  - [x] `Box<Self>`
  - [x] `Rc<Self>`
  - [x] `Arc<Self>`
  - [x] `Pin<P> where P is one of the types above`
  - [x] **Does not have a where Self: Sized bound** (receiver type of Self (i.e. self) implies this).

> Explicitly non-dispatchable functions require:

> **Have a where Self**: Sized bound (receiver type of Self (i.e. self) implies this).

> **Include the requirement that object-safe traits do not require Self:Sized**

> And specify that methods may include where Self:Sized to overcome object safety restrictions.


# Object Safety
Object safety is a set of rules and restrictions that does not allow trait objects to be constructed
*to convert any type into a trait object*, methods on the type need to be an instance—one that takes **self** by reference.
```rust
trait Foo {
    fn foo(&self);
}
```
## Dispatchable

> Dispatch is the mechanism to determine **which specific version of code is actually run when it involves polymorphism.** 

> Two major forms of dispatch are **static dispatch and dynamic dispatch**. While Rust favors static dispatch, it also supports dynamic dispatch through a mechanism called ‘trait objects’.

>The code that results from **monomorphization (early binding)** is doing [[static_dispatch]], which is when the compiler knows what method you’re calling at compile time. This is opposed to dynamic dispatch, which is when the compiler can’t tell at compile time which method you’re calling.

> Process of method resolution in a **polymorphic(late binding)** context is called dispatch.

> **Invoking the method is called dispatching**. In mainstream languages that support polymorphism, the dispatch may happen in either of the following ways:

### Static Dispatch


> When the **method to invoke is decided at compile time**, it is known as [[static_dispatch]] or early binding. The method's signature is used to decide the method to call, and all of this is decided at compile time. In Rust, **generics exhibit** this form of dispatch because even though the generic function can accept many arguments, a specialized **copy** of the function is generated at compile time with that concrete type.

> The compiler reads the values that have been used in Option<T> instances and identifies two kinds of Option<T>: one is i32 and the other is f64. As such, it expands the generic definition of Option<T> into Option_i32 and Option_f64, thereby replacing the generic definition with the specific ones.

> *The monomorphized* version of the code looks like the following. The generic Option<T> is *replaced* with the specific definitions created *by the compiler*:

> Because Rust compiles generic code into code that specifies the type in each instance, we pay **no runtime cost for using generics**. When the code runs, it performs just as it would if we had duplicated each definition by hand. The process of monomorphization makes Rust’s generics extremely efficient at runtime.This is opposed to dynamic dispatch.

```rust
let integer = Some(5);
let float = Some(5.0);

enum Option_i32 {
    Some(i32),
    None,
}
enum Option_f64 {
    Some(f64),
    None,
}
fn main() {
    let integer = Option_i32::Some(5);
    let float = Option_f64::Some(5.0);
}
```

### Dynamic

A dynamically sized type (DST) is a type without a statically known size or alignment.

## Summery

> Traits, along with generics, provide both kinds of code reuse, either through [[monomorphization]] (early binding) or through runtime polymorphism (late binding). 

> The decision on when to use which depends on the context and the needs of the application in question. Often, **[[error]]** types are taken toward the **dynamic** dispatch train as they are supposed to be code paths that **rarely get executed**. 

> **Monomorphization** can be handy for **small use cases**, but the downside to it is that it introduces **code bloat and duplication, which affects the cache line and increases binary size**. 

> However, of these two options, **static** dispatch should be preferred unless there is a hard constraint on binary size.


## Glossery

> `receiver` : for  exampele of type of Self (i.e. self) implies this.

> Object-safe traits = Dispatchable

> Trait objects = Dynamic Dispatch = fat pointer == only be created as a reference == unsized type
