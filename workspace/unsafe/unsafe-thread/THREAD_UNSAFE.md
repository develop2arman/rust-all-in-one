## Implementing an Unsafe Trait

 Another use case for unsafe is implementing an unsafe trait. 

 A trait is unsafe when at least one of its methods has some invariant that By using unsafe impl, we’re promising that  we’ll uphold the invariants that the compiler can’t verify.

 We can declare that a trait is unsafe by adding the unsafe keyword before trait and marking the implementation of the 

 By using unsafe impl, we’re promising that we’ll uphold the invariants that the compiler can’t verify.

`As an example,` recall the Sync and Send marker traits, the compiler implements these traits automatically if our types are composed entirely of Send and Sync types. 

 If we implement a type that contains a type that is not Send or Sync, such as raw pointers, and **we want to mark that type as Send or Sync, we must use unsafe**. Rust can’t verify that our type upholds the guarantees that it can be safely sent across threads or **accessed from multiple threads**; therefore, we need to do those checks manually and indicate as such with unsafe.

```rust,compile_fail,no_run
trait as unsafe too
{
Sync and Send are examples of unsafe traits.
}
unsafe trait Foo {
    // methods go here
}
unsafe impl Foo for i32 {
    // method implementations go here
}
```

```rust
unsafe trait Foo {
    fn bar(&self, other: i32) -> i32;
}

unsafe impl Foo for i32 {
    fn bar(&self, other: i32) -> i32 {
        self * self + other * other
    }
}
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;
    unsafe {
        println!("The result is {}", x.bar(y));
    }
}
```

> Output: The result is 125
