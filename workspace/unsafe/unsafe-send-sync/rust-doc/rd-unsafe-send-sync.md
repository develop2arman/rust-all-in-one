[[Sync]] [[Send]]

To demonstrate how you can work with types that do not implement the Sync and Send traits within an unsafe block, let's create a simple example. This will involve defining a custom trait and a struct that does not implement this trait. We'll then show how to safely transfer ownership of an instance of this struct into an unsafe block.

First, let's define our custom trait and struct. For simplicity, let's assume our trait is called MyTrait, and our struct is called MyStruct. We won't implement Sync or Send for these because they might not be safe to share across threads or send between threads due to some internal state or behavior.

```rust
trait MyTrait {
    fn do_something(&self);
}

struct MyStruct {
    value: i32,
}

impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
    fn do_something(&self) {
        println!("Doing something with value: {}", self.value);
    }
}
```

Now, let's write a function that takes ownership of a MyStruct instance and moves it into an unsafe block. Inside this block, we'll call the method defined by MyTrait.

```rust
fn use_my_struct_in_unsafe_block(mut my_struct: MyStruct) {
    // Safe to move `my_struct` into the unsafe block because we're not sharing it or sending it across threads.
    unsafe {
        my_struct.do_something();
        // After using `my_struct` inside the unsafe block, we can still use it outside if needed.
        my_struct.value = 42; // This would normally cause a borrow error outside the unsafe block.
    }

    // Now that we're out of the unsafe block, Rust's safety checks apply again.
    my_struct.do_something(); // This works fine now.
}
```

To tie everything together, here's how you could call use_my_struct_in_unsafe_block:

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_struct = MyStruct { value: 10 };
    use_my_struct_in_unsafe_block(my_struct);

    // The struct is still valid after being used in the unsafe block.
    my_struct.do_something(); // This prints "Doing something with value: 42"
}
```

In this example, MyStruct does not implement Sync or Send, so it cannot be shared across threads or sent between threads directly. However, since we're only moving the struct into an unsafe block (not sharing or sending it), Rust allows us to bypass the usual safety checks. Inside the unsafe block, we can call methods on the struct without violating any safety guarantees, as long as we ensure that the struct is not accessed concurrently or transferred across thread boundaries elsewhere in our program.
