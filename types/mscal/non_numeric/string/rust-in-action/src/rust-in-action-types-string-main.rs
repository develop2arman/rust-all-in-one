/// ## What
/// Rust includes some tolerances to allow comparisons between stringing-point values.
/// These tolerances are defined as f32::EPSILON and f64::EPSILON. To be more precise,
/// itâ€™s possible to get closer to how Rust is behaving under the hood, as the following small example shows.
///
/// ## How
/// `TODO`
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `Arg1` - This is the [your type] to [your verb] the [your struct/func name]
///
/// # Return
/// 'nothing'
///
/// ## Example
/// ```rust,compile_fail,ignore
